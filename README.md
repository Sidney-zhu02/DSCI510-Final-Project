# DSCI 510 Final Project

**Title:** Does Spending More on Education Lead to Better Global University Rankings?  
**Author:** Hengxiao Zhu (zhuhengx@usc.edu)

## 1.Project Overview

This project investigates the relationship between a country's education spending and its representation in the QS Top 100 World University Rankings. Using data from the World Bank and QS, the study integrates education investment (% of GDP), GDP, and population with university performance to uncover patterns and possible correlations.

## 3.Data Sources

| Data                     | Source        | Method         | Years       |
|--------------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Education (% of GDP)     | World Bank    | API + Interpolation | 2018–2022 |
| GDP                      | World Bank    | API + Interpolation | 2018–2022 |
| Population               | World Bank    | API + Interpolation | 2018–2022 |
| QS Rankings              | QS Top 100    | Scraped via requests + BeautifulSoup | 2024 |

## 4.Data Completion Strategy

- **Linear Interpolation** was used to fill missing values between known years.
  - E.g., France’s 2022 education spending was missing and interpolated from 2021 and 2020.

- **Manual Filling for Taiwan**:
  - GDP, population, and education % of GDP were added manually based on official estimates and public reports.
  - Taiwan is not included in World Bank datasets.

- **Hong Kong SAR**:
  - Education spending is not in the database, so we used ~3.2% based on government budget documents, and forward filled from 2018–2022.

- **Malaysia**:
  - Missing 2021–2022 education spending values were forward-filled from 2020 (~4.2%).

## 5.How to Run

Ensure your environment has the required libraries (see `requirements.txt`), then run:

```bash
# Step 1: Fetch QS Top 100 university ranking data
python source_code/scraper.py

# Step 2: Fetch World Bank data (GDP, population, education spending)
python source_code/get_data.py

# Step 3: Manually inspect / clean raw data
python source_code/clean_data.py       

# Step 4: Merge all datasets and interpolate missing values
python source_code/integrate_data.py

# Step 5: Generate plots and visual analysis
python source_code/analyze_visualize.py

```

## 6.Visualizations

All figures are saved in `figures/`. Key plots include:

- **QS Top 100 Distribution (bar chart)**  
- **Education Spending Trends (line chart)**  
- **Spending vs QS Count (scatter plot)**  
- **GDP vs Spending vs QS Performance (bubble chart)**  

Each chart is labeled and designed to be publication-ready.

---

## 7.Requirements

Install necessary libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn adjustText requests
```

---

## 8.Conclusion

- There is a **positive correlation** between education spending and QS performance — but not causality.
- Outliers like Singapore and Japan show strong QS presence despite moderate investment.
- Smaller nations like Switzerland punch above their weight due to targeted funding or high efficiency.
